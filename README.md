# RealShop

This mod is created to prevent the possibility of buying body parts for cars older than 2000 in the store. To obtain the necessary parts for the car you are working on, you will have to search for all the body elements in a junkyard, barns, or auctions. This mod makes the game a little more challenging and interesting. Also I hope that it will slightly change the gaming experience, making it a bit more challenging and engaging. I hope you will like it.

## Features include:

**IMPORTANT AND RECOMMENDED! This mod should be used only when you have unlocked the entire branch for repairing parts and have purchased the necessary machines for repairing body and other parts.

Features include:

- You will need to search for the necessary parts for old cars and restore them; it is no longer possible to buy new parts for retro or old cars.
- Now junkyards, barns, and auctions take on a different meaning.
- Now all body and interior parts can be repaired.
- Now you can repair generic parts from all non-default manufacturers.
- Added a configuration file where you can:
           - Change the year for cars that will not appear in the shop.
           - Change the binding key to enable or disable the mod.
           - Add or remove specific brands from the list that won't appear in the shop.


Important! Many parts in the shop will be unavailable. Now, junkyard visits have become a necessity. Non-default items won't be found in the shop, but you can find them in the barn, at auctions, or in the junkyard, and then repair them.

Realism is getting closer, enjoy! :-)

In the plans, I will remove engines, tires, and other items for old and retro cars from the store. Now junkyards, barns, and auctions take on a different meaning.
