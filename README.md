# RealShop
This mod was created with the aim of adding more realism to the game. In real life, it's unlikely that you can buy a new body part or engine for cars older than 2005. In this mod, I'm trying to address this issue to introduce more realism. There's still a lot of work to be done, but you can already experience and evaluate a certain part of the new gameplay. I hope you'll enjoy this challenge because now, to assemble an old car, you'll have to visit junkyards, auctions, or barns to find the necessary parts. Since the mod is in its early stages of development, I highly recommend starting to play with it after you've unlocked all the repair tools in your garage and explored the entire branch of body part repairs. Good luck in restoring retro cars! ðŸ˜Š

## IMPORTANT AND RECOMMENDED! It is recommended to use this mod only after unlocking the entire branch for repairing parts and purchasing the necessary machines for repairing body and other parts.

## Key Features:

1. Junkyards, barns, and auctions now play a significant role in the game.
2. A wide range of car parts for vehicles older than 2005 is currently disabled in the shopping catalog.
3. Access to some auction features is restricted.
4. Access to the car dealership is restricted.
5. All body and interior parts can be repaired.
6. Configuration file allows for customization, including:
- Changing the year for cars that will not appear in the shop (add name to config section).
- Customizing the key binding to enable or disable the mod.
ï»¿ï»¿- Maintaining a list of old engines and parts that are no longer sold in the store, such as "(I3)", "(I6 B)", "(V8)", "(V8 OHV)".
- Whitelist addition: If a desired item is not available or not displayed in the store, it can be added to the configuration file whitelist for visibility.
ï»¿ï»¿- You can enable or disable visiting the store. You can also enable or disable the auction where higher-quality cars were sold
ï»¿ï»¿- Adding or removing specific brands from the list that won't appear in the shop.

## Last update v 0.3.

1. added groups for different car release periods, now the older the car, the more expensive it is.
2. a group for very rare and sports cars has been added, with their prices being very high.
3. all prices for parts have been revised. Now, it is easy and not expensive to assemble cars that are younger than 2005, and all the parts for them should be available in the store.
4. the store has been fixed and redesigned, now most of the various car parts items are displayed correctly.

This mod seriously changes the pricing policy of gameplay. Now, parts and repairs for retro cars will be very expensive, so be sure to check what's available in the junkyard - it may be the most cost-effective way to get the necessary parts.

Global mod update: Introduces price changes for cars based on age, adds a group for rare sports cars, and revises part prices. Gameplay now emphasizes cost-effective part sourcing for retro cars.

Exclusive cars:  Mercedes-Benz W198 300SL (1954), Aston martin DB5 (1963), JUEYUAN QIANFENG (1959), DC TYPHOON (1964), FORD GT 40 (1965), JAGUAR E-TYPE (1961), JAGUAR XJ220 (1992), LOTUS ESPRIT S1 (1975), SAKURA GT20 (1969)

(these cars are the most expensive in the game, but you can modify this list in the configuration file.)

Sport cars: PAGANI ZONDA REVOLUTION, PORSCHE 911 RS AMERICA (964),  PORSCHE 911 Turbo S (964)  (1993), PORSCHE CARRERA GT (2003), PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 4S (991) (2016)

Retro 1950_1959: DELRAY CUSTOM (1957),  SALEM 1500 (1955)

and etc....

----

It's important to note that many parts in the shop will be unavailable, making regular visits to junkyards necessary. Non-default items can't be found in the shop, but can be discovered in barns, auctions, or junkyards and then repaired. Make sure to replace the old configuration file with the new one.

## With this mod, realism is brought closer to the game. Enjoy the enhanced experience!
