# RealBuyParts

This mod is created to prevent the possibility of buying body parts for cars older than 2000 in the store. To obtain the necessary parts for the car you are working on, you will have to search for all the body elements in a junkyard, barns, or auctions. This mod makes the game a little more challenging and interesting. Also I hope that it will slightly change the gaming experience, making it a bit more challenging and engaging. I hope you will like it.

## Features include:

You will need to search for the necessary parts for old cars and restore them; it is no longer possible to buy new parts for retro or old cars.

## How install: 
1. Download realshop.dll
2. Download and install [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements) ----> **!!!!   Only 0.5.7 VERSION**
3. Copy the dll file to the **"Car Mechanic Simulator 2021\Mods"**

## 
In the plans, I will remove engines, tires, and other items for old and retro cars from the store. Now junkyards, barns, and auctions take on a different meaning.
