# RealShop

This mod enhances the gameplay experience by introducing restrictions on purchasing body parts for cars older than 2005 from the store. Instead, players are encouraged to search for the required parts in junkyards, barns, or auctions. This adds a new level of challenge and interest to the game, making it more engaging.

**IMPORTANT AND RECOMMENDED!** It is recommended to use this mod only after unlocking the entire branch for repairing parts and purchasing the necessary machines for repairing body and other parts.

##Key Features:

1. Junkyards, barns, and auctions now play a significant role in the game.
2. All body and interior parts can be repaired.
3. Configuration file allows for customization, including:
		- Changing the year for cars that will not appear in the shop (add name to config section).
		- Customizing the key binding to enable or disable the mod.
		- Adding or removing specific brands from the list that won't appear in the shop.
		- Maintaining a list of old engines and parts that are no longer sold in the store, such as "(I3)", "(I6 B)", "(V8)", "(V8 OHV)".
		- Whitelist addition: If a desired item is not available or not displayed in the store, it can be added to the configuration file whitelist for visibility.

Now the following items are available for expansion: "I4 DT224", "I4 204PT", "V8 392 Hemi", "V10 OHV MT8", "V10 OHV", "V12 AM11", "B6 MA", "B6 M64", "eDen-1H", "Proton e-R", and more.

It's important to note that many parts in the shop will be unavailable, making regular visits to junkyards necessary. Non-default items can't be found in the shop, but can be discovered in barns, auctions, or junkyards and then repaired. Make sure to replace the old configuration file with the new one.

With this mod, realism is brought closer to the game. Enjoy the enhanced experience!

In the plans, I will remove engines, tires, and other items for old and retro cars from the store. Now junkyards, barns, and auctions take on a different meaning.
